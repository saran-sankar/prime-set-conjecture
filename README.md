# prime-set-conjecture
Computational attempt at verifying a number theoretic conjecture of mine

<b>Conjecture</b>

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Let\:\rho(C) = \prod_{c_j \in{C}}{c_j}\:+1" border="0"/>, and F(N) be the set of all prime factors of N. 

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Let\:E_i = E_{i-1} \cup \left\{z \in{F}(\rho(C)): C \in{P}(E_{i-1})\right\} for\:i>1" border="0"/>

where P(E) is the power set of E. Let <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?E_1 = \{2\}" border="0"/>

If p is a prime number, then <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\exists%20i%20\in%20N%20\:%20(p%20\in%20E_i)" border="0"/>

<b>Goal</b>

Computationally verify this conjecture for as many of the first prime numbers as possible. 

<b>Results of the first attempt</b>

Within 5 iterations, the conjecture was verified for all of the first 2595 prime numbers. 

<b>Update</b>

It turned out that a similar proposition had a simple proof:

This says that for any prime number p, we can find a set C. But it is not necessarily that this set or the corresponding multiple of p will be generated by our process.
